Comp_N_Clear_Python

Small utilities to copy and delete files from the command line.

Files added:
- parser.py (placeholder)
- copier.py: simple file copying helper
- deleter.py: simple file deletion helper
- main.py: CLI wrapping copy/delete

Usage examples:

python main.py copy path/to/src.txt path/to/dest.txt
python main.py delete path/to/file.txt --ignore-missing

These modules are intentionally small and focused; adapt to your project needs.
